<p>Are you stuck planetside with those boring old terrestrial games? Hop into the cockpit with Mister Quasar's Courier Serivce! Test your mettle against a slew of classic arcade genres, updated for the future. That's right! It's a "retro" "sci-fi" "indie" "game"! And it's up to you to help the crew of the Miss Lonelyhearts stay alive (and maybe even stay airborne). Survive against fearsome space pirates, multiplanet crime syndicates, and the local street toughs. Save your struggling family business, save your friends, and maybe save the galaxy? Okay, you won't have to save the galaxy, but you will have to save your skin!</p>
